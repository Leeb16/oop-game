# oop-game
## Module 4 Project

In this project an object-orientated javaScript game has been created.

The rules of the game are that you have to guess the hidden phrase on the screen in which you have 5 lives and if you use all of your lifes, the game ends.

### Personal style changes to the project include:
 * Changed the colour of the wrong and correct keys when selected
 * Changed the heading font to 'Permenant Marker'
 * Added a 1 second timer to the end of the game so the user can see the end results before the page changes
 * Added a gif to each of the winning and losing pages
